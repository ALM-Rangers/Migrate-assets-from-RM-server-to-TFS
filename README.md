### What ###
As Bob,the Release Manager, I would like to migrate my assets from 2015 or 2013 U4 RM server to VSO, and start using the Release hub in Team Web Access. 

### What about TFS? ###
This solution currently targets VSO, but will be applicable to migration to the new RM features in TFS in a future version of TFS.

### Why ###
As the new release management capabilities are going to part of TFS, and as customers are currently using the WPF client along with RM server, there is a need to help them migrate their assets into the new model. Most of these customers are using agent-based release templates. 

Their release templates are scripted using the RM serverâ€™s XAML based workflow system. The next generation of release management features in TFS are based on a light-weight workflow system and do not have all the fine-grain tasks that were otherwise available in RM server.

However, since both of them leverage Powershell heavily, it is possible to at least partially migrate the data from one to the other. This project aims to provide the guidance and tooling to help you with this migration.
